/*
You are given an array A consisting of N integers.

For each number A[i] such that 0 â‰¤ i < N, we want to count the number 
of elements of the array that are not the divisors of A[i]. We say 
that these elements are non-divisors.

For example, consider integer N = 5 and array A such that:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
For the following elements:

A[0] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[1] = 1, the non-divisors are: 3, 2, 3, 6,
A[2] = 2, the non-divisors are: 3, 3, 6,
A[3] = 3, the non-divisors are: 2, 6,
A[4] = 6, there aren't any non-divisors.
Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns a sequence of 
integers representing the amount of non-divisors.

Result array should be returned as an array of integers.

For example, given:

    A[0] = 3
    A[1] = 1
    A[2] = 2
    A[3] = 3
    A[4] = 6
the function should return [2, 4, 3, 2, 0], as explained above.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [1..50,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..2 * N].

function solution(A) {
    const N = A.length;

    let numCnt = new Array((N * 2) + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i in A) {
        numCnt[A[i]]++;
    }

    let divCnt = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        let divisors = 0;

        for (let j = 1; j * j <= A[i]; j++) {
            if (A[i] % j === 0) {
                divisors += numCnt[j];

                if (A[i] / j !== j) {
                    divisors += numCnt[A[i] / j];
                }
            }
        }

        divCnt[i] = N - divisors;
    }

    return divCnt;
